I am a dedicated AI/Digital Specialist at the Gyeongbuk Development Institute, advancing public service through generative AI applications. My transition from a postdoctoral tenure in urban planning and analytics at UNIST to focusing on AI's potential marks a commitment to fostering smart, sustainable urban environments.

Here, I'll share insights and progress on making city services smarter and more responsive with AI. Join me as we explore simple, smart solutions for better public services.
