I am a dedicated Data Analyst and AI Specialist at the Gyeonggi Credit Guarantee Foundation (GCGF), working to enhance support for small businesses and entrepreneurs through data-driven insights and AI applications. My transition from a postdoctoral tenure in urban planning and analytics at UNIST to focusing on data analysis in credit guarantee services marks a commitment to fostering a robust and sustainable local economy.
