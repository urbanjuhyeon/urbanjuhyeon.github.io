I am an Associate Research Fellow at the Housing & Urban Finance Research Institute of the Housing & Urban Guarantee Corporation (HUG). With a Ph.D. in Urban Planning from UNIST, I specialize in utilizing Big Data, AI, and Spatial Econometrics to address urban and financial challenges. My experience includes data-driven strategy development at the Gyeonggi Credit Guarantee Foundation and regional policy research at the Gyeongbuk Research Institute.
