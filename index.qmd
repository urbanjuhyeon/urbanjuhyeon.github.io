I'm an urban planner and data scientist. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Urban Planning & Analytics Lab in UNIST. My interests include urban analytics, Data mining/visualization, and smart cities. I lead several projects that develop WiFi sensing systems that identify pedestrian behaviors and text-mining techniques exploring commercial visitors' experiences.
